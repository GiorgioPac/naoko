# Introduction: The Aerodynamic Challenge 🎯

[cite_start]The addition of a cargo box to a vehicle represents a classic aerodynamic trade-off: gaining storage space at the cost of efficiency[cite: 704]. [cite_start]The objective of this project was to investigate how different cargo box configurations alter the airflow around an **Audi A4 Sedan**, specifically looking for a design that minimizes aerodynamic drag ($C_D$) and, consequently, fuel consumption[cite: 706, 708].

[cite_start]The study was conducted using a dual approach: **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** with OpenFOAM to visualize the flow physics, and **Experimental Testing** in a wind tunnel to validate the results[cite: 706, 1069].

## Methodology

* [cite_start]**Numerical Analysis (OpenFOAM):** We performed steady-state RANS simulations using the `simpleFoam` solver and the $k-\omega$ SST turbulence model[cite: 724, 725]. This setup allowed us to capture the complex wake interactions and boundary layer separation caused by the bluff body of the box.
* [cite_start]**Experimental Validation:** A 1:15 scale model of the car was 3D printed and tested in a wind tunnel equipped with a force balance, ensuring the reliability of the numerical trends[cite: 1069, 1070].

## Qualitative Analysis of Flow Physics

### Impact of Box Placement on the Wake

Introducing a standard box on the roof significantly disrupts the vehicle's aerodynamics. [cite_start]The box acts as a bluff body in the free stream, forcing the flow to separate and creating a massive, low-pressure wake behind the car[cite: 704]. This pressure difference is the primary driver of increased drag.

[cite_start]In contrast, placing the box at the **rear of the vehicle ("Back Box")** places it within the car's existing "dead air" zone[cite: 853]. [cite_start]As shown in the velocity field comparison below, the Back Box maintains a much cleaner flow pattern similar to the car's native aerodynamics, whereas the roof box generates a large, high-energy wake[cite: 904].

### Visualization of Turbulence (Q-Criterion)

[cite_start]To understand the noise and drag generation, we analyzed the vortical structures using the Q-Criterion[cite: 905].

* [cite_start]**Roof Box:** Generates intense horseshoe vortices originating from the gap between the box and the roof, which travel downstream and increase turbulence[cite: 893].
* [cite_start]**Back Box:** Keeps the flow attached over the roofline, preventing the formation of large separating vortices[cite: 903].

## Experimental Validation and Fuel Consumption

[cite_start]The wind tunnel tests confirmed the trends observed in the CFD simulations[cite: 1132]. [cite_start]Despite the complexities of scaling, the force balance measurements verified that the **Back Box** is the superior aerodynamic solution[cite: 1140].

### Impact on Fuel Economy

[cite_start]The aerodynamic penalty of a roof box is not just theoretical; it translates directly into fuel consumption, especially at highway speeds where aerodynamic drag dominates over rolling resistance[cite: 1028].
[cite_start]The study concluded that choosing a **rear-mounted solution** effectively neutralizes the penalty of the extra load, offering significant fuel savings over long distances compared to traditional roof racks[cite: 851, 1050].
